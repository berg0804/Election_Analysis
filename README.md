## Election-Audit Summary
### The script created for this audit created a concise method of quickly analying a large amount of data. One of the key pieces of data is percentage of votes by county which can influence how future campaigns are conducted and how election resources are utilized for different counties. 
### The script can by modified as well. For example, instead of analzying county voter turnout as a percentage of the total votes, each county can be analyzed for voter turnout within the county. Additionally, the script can be modified to drill down to voter specifics (race, gender, socioeconomic demographics) or look at the data at a more macro level such as state instead of county.
### The created script can be used for all types of elections from school board to a presedential election.
